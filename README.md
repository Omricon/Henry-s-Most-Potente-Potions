# Henry’s Moste Potente Potions
Version: 1.0
## Introduction

These recipes are made to give you the best quality potions, while streamlining the brewing process as much as possible. That makes it easier to brew them repeatedly without needing to spend time on unnecessary steps.

I have tried to avoid reliance on using the hourglass, as I find it too often to be a step that just increases the time. So, it is mostly used if there are no instructions following it. If there are, then I have added steps to further the process while spending the correct amount of time to complete them. 

These potions were created with level 30 in alchemy, so it might be more challenging to achieve top quality at lower levels of alchemy as from my testing, timing precision requirements differ depending on your skill level. If you are experiencing lower quality potions, try to adjust the formula depending on 
Henry's remarks about the potion (lower/increase the number of times you blow the bellows, pre-prep the ingredients into the mortar or don’t, etc.).

If you are using dried ingredients, this may also lower the quality, so if you are getting lower quality potions, try to use fresh herbs where you can. All potions have been created with only fresh ingredients (except for herb paris).

A noteworthy shoutout to Lazarus, who gave me the idea to take shortcuts during potion brewing. I took his Saviour Schnapps recipe and refined it. I then took my learnings from that and applied it to the rest of the alchemy recipes in the game.

### Perks
- **Secret of Secrets** unlocks *Henry's level* of potions and poisons. However, not all alchemy recipes have levels. This guide will always deliver the best quality.
- **Secret of Matter / II** unlocks additional potions when brewing. Together they will give x6 potions and poisons, x8 soap, and x18 powders.
- **Secret of Equilibrium / II** is not required. The following guide does not require those perks to achieve maximum quality.  
  If you have taken one of these perks, you may create and consume *Lethean Water* to reset all your perks.

All potions were tested in version:  
*1.1.1-11377-release_1_1*
