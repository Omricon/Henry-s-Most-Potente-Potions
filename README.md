# Henry’s Moste Potente Potions
*By Omricon*  
Version: 1.2  
## Introduction
These recipes are made to give you the best quality potions, while streamlining the brewing process as much as possible. That makes it easier to brew them repeatedly without needing to spend time on unnecessary steps.  

### Alchemy level (READ ME)
Your alchemy level dictates how sensitive the brewing process is to timing errors. At higher levels you can get away with making shortcuts, while at lower levels your quality will decrease.  

This guide therefore has instructions for different levels of alchemy, to ensure you get strong/Henry's level quality no matter if your alchemy level is 7 or 30. Just make sure to follow the correct instructions depending on your alchemy level.  

If you're right at the level where it should be possible, you will need to be lighting quick in certain areas to actually achieve the highest quality. At level 30 most potions are easy to brew with the quickest method. However, if you are experiencing difficulty, try using the instructions that is for every level.

### Timing (READ ME)
Timing using the hourglass can be a bit counter intuitive, some of the recipes actually blatantly lie to the player, where one turn is actually half a turn or more than a turn of the hourglass. Additionally, there is a period of time where during an action where the brewing process has started counting, but you are unable to turn the hourglass, making the reliance on the hourglass to be difficult.  

The hourglass is *actually* a *10 second glass*, as that's how long it takes for the sand to run out. Therefore *halfway* means ~5 seconds and *just before* means there is ~1-2 seconds left in the hourglass.  

### Dried herbs
* Without **Dark Arts Apprentice** active, you may use up to 66% dried herbs without it being considered a loss in quality. **Note:** At least one herb must be fresh (i.e. not charcoal or boar's tusk).
* With **Dark Arts Apprentice** active, you may replace all herbs with dried herbs without it being considered a loss in quality.

Testing of dried herbs was done with Mintha perfume and Dollmaker poison, where you can get away with 3/5 and 2/3 herbs being dried, resulting in a 66% dried/fresh ratio.  

### Perks
- **Secret of Secrets** unlocks *Henry's level* of potions and poisons. However, not all alchemy recipes have levels. This guide will always deliver the best quality.
- **Secret of Matter / II** unlocks additional potions when brewing. Together they will give x6 potions and poisons, x8 soap, and x18 powders.
- **Secret of Equilibrium / II** is not required. The following guide does not require those perks to achieve maximum quality. If you have taken one of these perks, you may create and consume *Lethean Water* to reset all your perks.
- **Dark Arts Apprentice** allows you to use only dried herbs if you brew the potion within 00:00–04:30. It also allows you to get up to one mistake without lowering the quality of the final product. However, it will lower the quantity. Therefore it is recommended to not cut corners to get the max quantity.

### Leveling Alchemy
If you want to level alchemy I would recommend mostly brew Saviour Schnapps until you can brew Henry's level quality. Then after that, a mix of Fox, Marigold Decoctions, and Saviour Schnapps. Make sure to drink a Henry's Fox potion for the 50% xp gain when leveling alchemy (or any stat/skill for that matter).  

All three potions are useful throughout your playthrough from beginning to end, and even though some potions are faster to brew, you won't necessarily use them during your playthrough.  

Additionally, Charcoal, Marigold, and Nettle is easily obtained almost anywhere on both maps. Belladonna and St. John's Wort is a little more rare, but still rather easily found on fields and in forests.  

### Henry's Remarks
Henry can have remarks about the brewing process if something goes wrong. These are often misleading and the issue might be something else entirely, so take the remarks with a fistful of salt.  

Using this guide you shouldn't have Henry complain. However, if you're too slow when following the steps Henry will complain. Some of the steps are time sensitive, especially at lower alchemy levels.  

### Language
I have used the word *Add* whenever something is added to a **Cauldron**, and the word *Put* whenever something is added to a **Mortar** or **Dish**. The text is bolded in such a way that it should be enough to simply read the bolded text. These choices are made to make it easier to follow the steps listed.  

### Recognition
[Lazarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VstG120CoPM) - Origin for the idea of not following the recipes directly.  
[RandomedXY](https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1ir7sw7/comment/md7uk9k/) - Even faster Saviour Schnapps recipe which helped me do further testing to improve the rest of the recipes.
